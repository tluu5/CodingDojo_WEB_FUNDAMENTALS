// What is a variable?
// Placeholder for a vaule
// Make me a variable called name and put your name as the value
// var name = "Thieu";
// Make me a variable called age and put your age as the value
// var age = 23;
// Pretend it's your birthday and add 1 to your age
// age += 1 age++ age = age + 1
// Make me a variable called isStudent and set the value to true
// var isStudent = true;
// What do we call the variable type I just had you make?
// boolean
// What is a conditional statement and why are they handy?
// Perform action when certain condition is true
// Write me a conditional statement that checks if your age is under 25. If it is, print "Wow, you're pretty young!" if it's not, print "Age = wisdom"
// if(age<25){
    console.log("Wow, you're pretty young!");
}
else{
    console.log("Age=wisdom");
}
// Write me a conditional statement that checks if you are a student. If you are, print "Good on you for learning to code!"
// if(isStudent==true){
    console.log("Good on you for learning to code!")
}
// Write a for loop that starts at 0, ends at 10, and increments up by 1. Inside the loop, print the value of i
// for(var i=0; i<=10; i++){
    console.log(i);
}
// Now write me a for loop that starts at 20, ends at 1, and decrements by 2. Inside the loop, print the value of i
// for(var i = 20; i>=1; i-=2){
    console.log(i)
}
// Make me an array with the values [3,7,10,2,4,18]
// var array=(3,7,10,2,4,18);
// Pop quiz: what index value do arrays ALWAYS start on?
0
// Pop quiz: if I wanted to grab the 2nd value in an array, how would I write that?

// Pop quiz: how would I grab the LAST value in an array?

// Push the value 5 into the array you made

// Write me a for loop that traverses through the array from before and prints the values at each index

// Now add to that loop some logic that checks if the value is greater than 5 and ONLY print the value if it is larger than 5

// Function time! Tell me what a function is and why we use them?

// If I write function doAThing(value)...what is the term we use for that "value" inside the parentheses?

// Write me a function that, when called, prints out "Hello there!"

// Now add the ability for the function to accept a name and print out "Hello there {given name here}!"

// Quick! Tell me the coolest thing you've learned this week!

// What are you most proud of yourself for figuring out this week?

// Are you excited to learn more?

// What can we do to make your time with us even better?
